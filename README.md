# Dungeon Builder App

## Built with JavaScript, Axios, CSS and HTML

> For the project I made use of two free to use Dungeon & Dragons APIs, '<https://5e-bits.github.io/docs/>'
> and, <https://open5e.com/>. Both API's provide the ability to get a vast amount of information about building
> characters, monsters , spells and rules of gameplay. I started off the project thinking I was going to build
> characters, but being that I had a limited time to complete this project, I opted to go in the direction of building dugeon maps and making use of the monsters data that both API's provided.
> One of the challenges with working with both API's is the structure of the data that is provided, as well as the variety of monster properties populated for each monster. I really found myself wishing that I was doing this project in react which would have made the process of displaying the monster view page a lot easier.
